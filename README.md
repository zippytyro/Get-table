# **Get-table**

Hello everyone,

I have made this website which helps you to find the multiplication table of any number within a second.

How to use it?

A user just has to input the number into the box, then that user has to click on the get answer button, after that within a second, the multiplication table of that entered number will come.

A user can find the tables from 1 to 9999999 by using this website.

You can see the website by visiting this link:- https://get-table.now.sh/

Thank you.
